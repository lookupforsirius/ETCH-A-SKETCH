I expect that this don't take me a week like the other projects hahahaha , but i have learn so much so i hope that in this project learn new things.

Ok so after i finish this project, i had learn so many thing and i see how powerfull can be the javascript, but
my best ability is to ask me "What i need to know to do this" so for example i first learn how to do css grid, 
then how to do this with javascript and later how to do this with any value that someone type.

This project take about 8 hours, so i am improving in my times.
